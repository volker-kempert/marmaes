<h1> <a name="what_is_marmeas">What is MARMEAS? </a></h1>

<b>MARMEAS </b> is an abbreviation for 
<em> MARking and MEAsurement on objects on images </em>
<p/>
<b>MARMEAS</b> is a handy tool is to identify objects on an image and let the application
do geometric or photometric measurements on those objects.
<p/>
<b>MARMEAS </b> allows to accelerate computer vision projects 
that lead to process automation:
<p/>
Assume the following situation where
images are already acquired from a production process but the objects of 
interest, the objects to detect, measure and check against are not known 
yet.
The <b> MARMEAS </b>  tool allows to manually mark those object on the image and use 
those markings as a reference database (ground truth) for computer vision. 
The reference database will be probably split apart: 
<ul>
<li>Primarily 
to a <em> training database </em>, for the sake of teaching  
computer vision methods/parameters to achive optimal 
measurement and quality check performance.(Tuning aspect)
</li>
<li>
Secondarily to a <em> test database </em> used to proof 
the image analytical performance on 
an independet test set. (Generalization aspect)
</li>
</ul>
Alternatively, any other means where objects need to be interactively marked and 
object features need to be determined and visualized this <b> MARMEAS </b> tool 
might be of interest.

<h1> <a name="usecases"> Application Scenarios </a> </h1>

Lets call our users by name just to indicate that they are different 
persons with different intentions. 

<ul>
<li>
	<b>Alice investigates a new image ad-hoc</b>
	<p/>
	Alice just want a quick idea what characteristics a certain object on an 
	image has. Therefore Alice selects an appropriate object model e.g. a line
	and marks the start and end point. The system computes the intensity profile,
	the line length and other measure for Alice. 
</li>

<li>
	<b>Bob visually examines the objects and measurements, 
	that are made available for an image.</b>
	<p/>
	Bob loads the image and also the marked objects. The system visualizes the 
	geometric positions of the objects and Bob can select any object he 
	is interested in and the system will present the relevant measures.
	Bob can add new or remove existing measurements on that object.
</li>

<li>
	<b>Alice marks consistently objects for determining ground truth.</b>
	<p/>
	Alice loads an image and marks on each image a set of objects that are 
	important to know later on. 
	This could be for development of an object detection algorithm, following
	the learing from data approach. Once she is done with one image Alice saves
	all the markings and measurements in a machine readable (xml) file.
	The repeats her marking activities on a lot
	of images of the same kind. Alice uses image templates and object templates
	to automate the manual marking as much as possible. 
</li>

<li>
	<b>Bob marks consistently objects of the same kind on same kind of 
	images for validating purposes.</b>
	<p/>
	This is the same as the activity as before, exect that Bob saves his marked
	objects on a different place than Alice. Thus, validation cross checking 
	can be done automatically (outside of this application) by any suitable 
	validation script.	
</li>
</ul>

<h1> <a name="features">Major Features</a></h1>

<ul>
<li><b>Unit of Measurements as of the original Objects</b>
	<p/>
	The <a href="glossary.html#image_context"> image context </a> allows to 
	maintain context information for images, among that are the original 
	unit of measurements of the objects as well as a conversion factor.
</li>
<li><b>Model driven Marking</b>
	<p/>
	Objects are described by an <a href="glossary.html#object_model"> 
	object model </a>, like a point, a line, a circle,
	an rectangle and so on, that fit most the shape of the object. The users
	selects the model and marks characteristics points of that model. Those
	characteristic points allow to compute the model parameters, to completely
	describe the location, size and shape of the object as compact as possible.
</li>
<li><b>Variety of supported Object Models</b>
	<p/>
	There are <a href="glossary.html#object_model"> 
	object models </a> for the most common shapes. Among them point, line 
	circle. The user can derive custom models by creating
	<a name="object_template"> object templates </a>.  
</li>
<li><b>Customizable Set of Measurments on Objects</b>
	<p/>
	The user can choose on an object bases which measurements he/she is 
	actually interested in.
</li>
<li><b>Variety of geometric Measurments</b>
	<p/>
	Dependent on  the applied 
	<a href="glossary.html#object_model"> object model </a>, specific
	measurements based on the object model/object shape and 
	the concrete markings of the object of interest are available. 
	Those measurements are figures like length, width, height, 
	geometric midpoint, circumfence, surface area, roundness  	
</li>
<li><b>Flexible Areas of Interest per Object</b>
	<p/>
	Areas of interest define the region on an image where intensity based
	measurements are taken for an object of interest.
	Therefore, areas of interest are bound to shape of the 
	object of interest. The AoI's are also customizable on object bases. 
	Depending on the <a href="glossary.html#object_model"> object model </a>
	multiple areas of Interest can be available.
</li>
<li><b>Variety of monochrome Intensity Measurements</b>
	<p/>
	Intensity Measurements are done on object of interest.
	Those measurement include intensity profiles as well as histograms. 
	On either data, statistical figures are available like mean, 
	variance/standard deviation, minimum, maximum, center of gravity,
	median, lower quartile, upper quartile 
</li>
<li><b>Machine readable XML output</b>
	<p/>
	Object information including the related measurement 
	and image context information are stored on 
	machine readable files in a XML format (called xml object description - xod)
	<p/>
	Those XML representation can be read later again to visualize and browse
	previously done object markings and measurements.
</li>
<li><b>Intuitive User Interaction </b>
	<p/>
	The application provides a state of the art user interface, that is easy to
	use and easy to get into. Figure out by yourself. Any feedback or suggestion
	for improvement is welcome.
</li>	
<li><b>Visual marking/object/measurement presentation </b>
	<p/>
	Compact presentation of an object and all related information as the object 
	shape, the object on the image, the key figures and measurement as well as
	histogram/profile plots.
	<p/> 
	Easy switching to another object or adding/modifying/removing of objects.
</li>
</ul>

<h1> <a name="get_involved"> How to get involved into Development</a></h1>
Since MARMEAS is a public domain project under GPL, it is up to you to 
contribute to the project in either way. There are 
several levels of involvement,  Any help is appreciated at any level. 
<p/>
<ul>
<li>You can inform about bugs</li>
<li>You can share your experience</li>
<li>You can make proposals for new features</li>
<li>You can do the programming</li>
</ul> 

<h2> Technical Notes for Developers </h2>
MARMEAS is written in C++ facilitating the 
Qt4 library and tools (Designer, ...)
<p/>
MARMEAS is is intended to be portable on Windows and Linux platforms.
Other platforms might follow if somebody is willing to do the port.
The platform specifics is considered as late as possible. 
The code is intended to be platform neutral as much as possible.
<p/>
Cmake is used to control the build, install and package process.
On windows NullSoft Installer is used, on linux debian packages are created. 
All that controlled by cmake.
<p/>
Unit tests are maintained as well facilitating the cppunit test framework.
Of course, those unit tests are there to assure functional correctness.
