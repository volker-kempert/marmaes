<h1> <a name="introduction">  </a> Introduction </h1>
This userguide is part of the MARMEAS help system. You get get into it by 
pressing <b>F1</b> or navigating to the help menu.
 
<h1> <a name="load_save"> Loading and Saving </a></h1>
<h2> File Types </h2>
There are several types of files MARMEAS deals with.
<dl>
<dt> Image Files </dt>
	<dd> 
	... are the input. Typical formats like jpg, bmp, png are supported. 
	Intensity measurements operate only on monochrome images at present.
	Image files will be never changed. Thus, read access is sufficient.
	</dd>
	<dd> 
<dt> Object Data Files <dt>
	<dd> 
	... are the xml-persistent mappings of all 
	<a href="glossary.html#object">marked objects </a> including their 
	<a href="glossary.html#object_model">object model </a>
	and their associated
	<a href="glossary.html#measurement">measurements </a>
	The related 
	<a href="glossary#image_context"> image context </a>.
	is included as well. 
	<p/>
	The extension is 'xod'.
	The extension will be added automatically 
	if nothing is added while saving the file.
	<p/> 
	</dd>
</dl>	

<h2><a name="load_image"> Load an Image File </a></h2>
	If you would like to start working on an image, just open via 
	<em> file -&gt; load </em> the file selection dialog. Select the file, and 
	trigger loading
<p/>
	The image file gets loaded and depending on the 
	<a href="glossary#image_context_template"> Image Context Template </a>
	a default location and default file name is determined of how the 
	object data file name will be. 
<p/> 
	If the not modifiable default template is used,
	the name will be like the image file base name, but with extension xod.
	The object data file will be stored at the very same directory 
	where the image file is loaded from.
<p/>
	<class id="note">
	Any objects and measurement you previously worked on 
	will be removed since they belong to another image. 
	Therefore, MARMEAS ask if you haven't saved the data before.
	</class>

<h2><a name="load_xod"> Load an Object Data File </a></h2>
	If you would like to review measurement, extend a have-way-done work
	just open via 
	<em> file -&gt; load </em> the file selection dialog. Select the 
	object data file, and trigger loading.
<p/>
	The object data file gets loaded, the internal object storage will be
	updated with the objects stored on the file, 
	the image context gets updated and the image is loaded,
	since this information is part of the image context. 
<p/>
	Any changes made to the <a href="glossary#image_context"> image context </a>
	or to the 	<a href="glossary.html#object">objects </a>
	will be saved to the very same file, if the save button is pressed. 
<p/>
	<class id="note">
	Any objects and measurement you previously worked on 
	will be removed since they belong to another image. 
	Therefore, MARMEAS ask if you haven't saved the data before.
	</class>
<p/>
	<class id="note">
	When saving object data all measurement will be stored (except full
	profie or histogram data) in order to allow later postprocessing.
	<p/>
	However, at loading the measurement will not be loaded but recomputed
	from the image.
	</class>	

<h2><a name="save_xod"> Save an Object Data File </a></h2>
	If like to make sure our markings/edits on object are not lost after
	you finish your work, you have to save.
<p/> 
	Independently where you started from (image file or object data file)
	only a <a href="glossary#xod"> object data file </a> is saved.
	The file location is the very same location of object data file
	you loaded from. If you loaded an image file instead of an object data file,
	the file name is determined from the 
	<a href="glossary#image_context">image context</a>. 
<p/>
	At any time you save a copy by choosing 
	<em> file -&gt; save as </em> the file selection dialog will show up. 
	Go to the desired directory, enter the appropriate file name 
	and trigger the save buttom.
<p/>
	<class id="note">
	If you do not provide an extension for the file name 'xod' will be 
	used automatically.
	</class>
<p/>
	<class id="note">
	It is strongly recommended to use 'xod' or alternatively 'xml'
	as extention for more easy handling of data autside of the MARMEAS
	application.
	</class>
<p/>
	

<h1><a name="image_context"> Image Context </a></h1>
	The <a href="glossary.html@image_context"> image context </a> is implicitly
	always present. By help of the image context it is possible to maintain data 
	that relates to the images. Every object you add, referes to the image 
	context. As you know, conversion factor and unit of measurement is part 
	of the image context. So, if you change unit of measurement from 'm' to 'mm'
	and the conversation factor from 0.5 to 500, the geometric measurements
	of all objects will be presented in 'mm' after that change.
<p/>
	The image context is always shown to the top-right, you can edit the
	by selecting <em> Edit -&gt; Image Context </em>.  
<p/>
	The <a href="glossary.html@image_context"> image context </a> not only 
	maintains data that is essential for measurement, but also data that 
	simplifies handling of data persistance, i.e. file name for image file,
	for object data file and additional two auxiliary free parameter to derive
	the file location from.
<p/>
	Whenever, an <a href="glossary#xod"> object data file </a> is loaded, the 
	image context is recreated from the object data file.
<p/>
	In case an image file is loaded,
	the default of the <a href="glossary.html@image_context"> image context </a>
	depents of the active
	<a href="glossary.html@image_context_template"> image context template</a>
	at the very moment an image file is loaded.
<p/>
	If you have not worked with image context templates, the default is
	operating on Pixel at a 1:1 conversation factor and the data object file
	will be stored in the same directory as the image file, using the same
	base name, but xod as extension. 
	  
<h1><a name="image_context_template"> Image Context Template</a></h1>
	The <a href="glossary.html@image_context"> image context </a> controlls
	what parameter are set when a new image is opened.
	<p/>
	Multipe image context templates can be maintained. They are persistantly
	stored using the Settings mechanism of QT4. 
	<p/> There is exactly one image context template that is active.
	this Image Context Template is used to set the initial values of an 
	<a href="glossary.html@image_context"> image context </a>
	whenever a new image file is loaded.


<h1><a name="objects"> Objects </a></h1>
	Objects are the main 'subjects of interest' within the MARMEAS application.
	Objects are the structures on an image where humans are able to clearly 
	distinghish and where humans are able to decide if a portion/pixel of an
	image belongs to an object or not.
<p/>
	Thus, humans can tell the application where an object is and how big an 
	object is by 
	<ol>
		<li> selecting an <a href="glossary.html#object_model">object model </a>
			 that fits best to the shape of the object; e.g. a circle model 
		</li>
		<li> marking prominent points (e.g. on the border line of the object)
		     in order to compute the model parameter from those points; e.g. 
		     compute the midpoint and the radius of the circle from three points
		     marked on the circumfence of the circle.
		 <li>
	</ol>
<p/> 
	Objects can be named by their shape (like point, line, circle, ...)
	or they can be named by ther semantic meaning (bold, hole, notch, ...)
<p/>
	Object are described by an
	an <a href="glossary.html#object_model">object model </a> and their 
	<a href="glossary.html#model_parameters"> model parameters</a>
<p/>
	Objects are the structures where measurements made on an 2d image are 
	assigned to.
<p/> 
	

<h2><a name="add_object"> Add an Object </a></h2>

	<ul>
		<li> Switch to the <em>'Add Object Mode'</em> </li>
		<li> Select the object model that you object you intend to had shall
		     have
		     <p/>
		     <class id="note"> The object model cannot be changed afterwards
		     </class>
	    </li>
	    <li> Set the marking points, as many as are required for the 
	         object model 
	    </li>
	</ul>
	Once you have added all points the object is created and visualized.
	Since you still at the <em>'Add Object Mode' </em> and the 
	object model has not changed. Marking further points will start adding 
	a new object of the same object model.


<h2><a name="remove_object"> Remove an Object </a></h2>

	<ul>
		<li> Switch to the <em>'Selection Mode'</em> </li>
		<li> Select the object you intend to delete.  </li>
	    <li> Press the <em> Del </em> key or use <em>Edit -&gt; Delete </em>
	         menu.	    </li>
	</ul>
	The application removes the object from the main memory. For persistance
	removal, call <em> File -&gt; Save </em> to save the changes.
	 
h2><a name="modify_object"> Modify an Object </a></h2>

	The only way to modify an object is to change the marker points you have 
	already set. This will change the model parameter and will initiate an 
	update of all measurements.
	<ul>
		<li> Switch to the <em>'Selection Mode'</em> </li>
		<li> Drag a marker point you like to move and drop it to the
		     place where it better fits to.
		     <p/>
		     The object parameter and measurements will be immediately 
		     recalculated.
		 </li>
		<li> Repeat that for all marker points in question. 
		 </li>
	</ul>
	The application removes the object from the main memory. For persistance
	removal, call <em> File -&gt; Save </em> to save the changes.

<h2><a name="object_config"> Customize the Measurements </a></h2>

	There is a convineant way to customize the measurements you are interested
	in. Next time you load the object data file. only the desired measurements
	will be shown.
	<ul>
		<li> Switch to the <em>'Selection Mode'</em> </li>
		<li> Select the object where you want to inspect the measurements  </li>
		<li> Open the Customize Measurement Dialog  
			 <em>Edit -&gt; Object Measurements </em> 
		 </li>
		<li> Switch on all measurements you need, switch of the others and
			 apply your edits. 
		 </li>
	</ul>
	The display of measurements will immediately update to the new desired 
	settings.
	<p/>
	After saving, and later on loading 
	only the customized measurements will be shown. Still, it is 
	possible to switch on the other measurements again.

<h1><a name="object_templates"> Object Templates </a></h1>

	will be implemented and described later

<h1><a name="base_object_model"> Base Object Models </a></h1>

	Base object models are easily to identify. They are named according to 
	their geometric shape like point, line, circle, rectangle ..., whereby
	derived object models, described by object templates rather named in 
	relation to the semantic meaning of object, like hole, bold, notch, etc.
<p/>
	All base models are implemented as QT4 plugins. More base object models
	can easily provided by any 3rd party without the need to rebuild the 
	core application.
<p/>
	The base object models are:
<ul>
	<li><a href="point.html"> Point </a> will be implemented later </li>
	<li><a href="line.html"> Line </a> </li>
	<li><a href="circle.html"> Circle </a> will be implemented later </li>
	<li><a href="rectangle.html"> Rectangle </a> will be implemented later </li>
	<li><a href="ellipse.html"> Ellipse </a> will be implemented later </li>
	<li><a href="grid.html"> Grid </a> will be implemented later </li>
	<li><a href="polygon.html"> Polygon </a> will be implemented later </li>
</ul>
   
<h1><a name="measurements"> Object Measurements </a></h1>
	
	For a given object on an image, certain features of the object can be 
	measured.
	The the <a href="glossary.html#object_model">object model </a>
	is facilitated in order to derive the correct 
	<a ref="glossary.html#measurement"> measurement </a>.
	
	There are two types of measurement:
	<ul>
		<li> geometric measurements </li>
		<li> photomtectric measurements </li>
		     
	</ul>

<h2><a name="geometric_measurements"> Geometric Measurements </a></h2>

	 The geometric measurement only depends on the object model
	 and it's parameters all geometric measurements consider the
	 <a ref="glossary.html#object_shape">  shape of the object </a>.
<p/>
	 Since the geometric measurements are dependent upon the 
	 <a href="glossary.html#object_model">object model </a>,
	 the specific measurements are described in the in the context 
	 of the base object models.
<p/>
	 There are some common geometric measurements, which follow next
	 
<h3><a name="bounding_box"> Bounding Box </a></h3>	 
<h3><a name="midpoint">     Midpoint </a></h3>	 
<h3><a name="Roundness">    Roundness </a></h3>	 
<h3><a name="Surface">      Surface </a></h3>	 
<h3><a name="Circumference"> Circumference </a></h3>	 

<h2><a name="photometric_measurements"> Photometric Measurements </a></h2>

	Photometric measurement are always computed on a set of pixel. This implies
	that that the image itself is available for the measurement and it also 
	requires a meaningful definition of which set of pixel is actually considered.
<p/>
	The current implementation can only deal with monochrome images. Color 
	information is not implemented (yet).
<p/>
	The set of pixel considered, depends on the area definition, assigned to 
	objects. The assignment is according to the object type and could be
	parameterized. Multiple pixel sets can be bound to one object. 
	Although, most often only one set is important.
<p/> 
	The assignment and parameters are adjusted at the <em> Edit Object </em>
	dialog, that is available on selected objects via <em> Edit </em> menu. 

<h3><a name="histogram"> Histogram </a></h3>	
	Histograms a computed on a set Pixel that is compact and two-dimensional.
	I.e. on an sub-area of the image under measurement. 
<p/>
	The concrete sub-areas considered and how are they parameterized is 
	dependent on the <a href="glossary.html#object_model">object model </a>
	and described in the context of each object.
<p/>
	The number of bins is equal to 256 (according to 8-bit monochrome images)
<p/>

</class>
	  
<h3><a name="profile"> Profile </a></h3>	 
<h3><a name="statistic_moments"> Statistic Moments  </a></h3>	 
	Statistic moments can be computed on any histogram or profile and allow
	for a kind of summary on the photometric measurements.

	</ul>
</class>

<h3><a name="quartile"> Quartile </a></h3>	 
	Quartiles, Five-Number Summaries and Seven-Number Summaries have been become
	more popular recently. As statistic moments they can be computed
	of any histogram or profile on photometric measurements.
	Furthermore, Quartiles, Medians, Five-Number Summaries and even 
	Seven-Number Summaries are the base for Box and Whisker Diagrams.
<p/>
	MARMEAS provides so called parametric Seven Number Sommaries 
	(min, 2%, 9%, 25%, 50%,75%, 91%,98%, max).
