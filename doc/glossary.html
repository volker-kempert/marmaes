<dl>

<dt><a name="base_object_type">  Base Object Type  </a></dt>
<dd>
Supported 2d object patterns including marking definitions, object model and
superset of possible measurements
</dd>



<dd><a name="cog"> Center of Gravity </a></dd>
<dt>describes ...; mainly used as the zero point/reference point
to relate the position of one object to the image or other objects. 
of an object tha</dt>
</dl>

<dl>

<dt><a name="image_context"> Image Context </a></dt>
<dd>
definitions describing a image with respect to the situation it was
taken and the circumstances it is of a value
like real units of measurement, retrieval into a repository (through
customised parameters, and directories)
<p/>
There is a quick access i.e. empty context to speed-up ad-hoc
assessments of images.
</dd>

<dt> Image Context Template</dt>
<dd>
Patterns that simplify the create of Image Contexts.
</dd>

<dt>Marking Point </dt>
<dd>
Is a point set by the user on a designated location of the surface of
an object, that allows to derive some information about the object
shape. I.e. this point is used to compute Object Model parameters.
</dd>


<dt><a name="measurement"> Measurement </a></dt>
<dd>
Any kind of geometric measurement (like size, max dimension, ...)
or intensity (like average intensity, variance of intensity) measurement 
done on the object. Photometric measurement is a synonym to photometric 
measurement
</dd>


<dt><a name="model_parameter"> Model Parameter </a></dt>
<dd>
are the paramter that describe an 
<a href="glossary.html#object_model">object model </a>
in a way that shape, location, ..., i.e. all geometric features of the 
object can be determined.
</dd>

<dt><a name="object"> Object </a></dt>
<dd>
Is a representation of a recognisable 2d imaginary structure, that can
be distinguished from other 2d imaginary structures.
it consists of the object model, geometric parameters, markings
information, name and notes and a set of shape and intensity
measurements
</dd>

<dt><a name="xod"> Object Data File </a></dt>
<dd>
Is a xml-formatted data/file containing  
<a href="glossary.html#object">marked objects </a> including their 
<a href="glossary.html#object_model">object model </a>
and their associated
<a href="glossary.html#measurement">measurements </a>
The related 
<a href="glossary#image_context"> image context </a>.
is included as well. 
<p/>
It is recommended to use the extension 'xod'.
</dd>

<dt> Object Fitter </dt>
<dd>
Is the facilitating method that allows to compute the model parameter
for a given model from the set of given marking points. It is possible
to have multiple Object Fitter for a single Object Model. Those fitter
consider different sets of marking points.
</dd>

<dt><a name="object_model">  Object Model <a></dt>
<dd>
Is a geometric figure that looks similar to the shape of the object.
The parameters of the figure (e.g. the radius in case the model is a
circle) are fitted, such that object model and object shape appear as
similar as possible.
</dd>

<dt> Object Marking </dt>
<dd>
Is the activity to determine marking points on the shape of the
object, that are used to compute model parameter that fit the object
model to the object.
</dd>

<dt> <a name="object_shape"> Object Shape</a> </dt>
<dd>
Data describing the 2d structure from a topological point of view, it
does not consider intensity information. Model based shapes are
characterised throughout a set of model dependent parameter
</dd>

<dt><a name="object_texture"> Object Texture </a></dt>
<dd>
Data describing the 2d structure considering all intensity information
(either grey-scale or colour channels).
</dd>

<dt><a name="object_type"> Object Type </a></dt>
<dd>
is a Base Object Type  extended by a name (representing the business
context) and  reduction to subset of relevant measurements (
The subset of measurements is derived from measurements of the
referenced base object type)
</dd>

<dt><a name="object_template">  Object Template</a></dt>
<dd>
Are used to create Objects of a specific Objects Type. I.e. Object
Templates define an Object Type.
